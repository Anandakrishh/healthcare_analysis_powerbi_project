## Solutions (Objectives)

1.
- The "Treatment Type" bar chart shows that Medication, Therapy, Surgery, and Vaccination are almost equally utilized, with slight variations.
- Medication and Therapy are the highest, with around 12.5K cases each.
2.
- The "Urbanization Rate by Gender" chart indicates a nearly equal distribution among Male (33.67%), Female (32.9%), and Other (33.43%).
- The "Affected by Diseases" table also reflects a near-even split between male and female patients.
3.
- The "Recovery Rate" graph shows a decreasing trend, starting from 192.8K for some diseases and going down to 179.9K for others.
- Diseases like Tuberculosis and Cholera have higher recovery rates, while conditions like Asthma have lower recovery rates (179.9K).

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:

- Total Patients Treated: 3,454.01K
- Top Disease by Cases: Cancer [ 176.27K ]
- Most Common Treatment Type: Medication & Therapy (12.5K each) 
- Highest Income Group Seeking Treatment: High-income (35.76%) 
- Gender Distribution in Urbanization:
 - 𝐌𝐚𝐥𝐞: 33.67%
 - 𝐅𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐞: 32.9%
